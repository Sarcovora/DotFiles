# Additional Changes

Use the mocha maroon theme from Catpuccin for LazyGit ([Github](https://github.com/catppuccin/lazygit))

- Use `lazygit --print-config-dir` to show where the config directory is.
- Paste the corresponding file from the lazygit config file in this repo into the `config.yml` there already.
